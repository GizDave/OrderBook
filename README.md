The application manages a database that tracks each user's portfolio and updates portfolio data as transactions are completed.
This data includes:
- Information about each user, including name and financial account balance
- A list of stocks bought and sold on the market
- How much of each stock any given user owns
- Buy requests: which user wants which stock and at what price
- Sell requests: which user wants to sell which stock and at what price
- Completed transactions, including when the transaction took place, how many shares were sold, and the total price for
those shares.

When a transaction takes place, the application should transfer the amount of money exchanged from the buyer's account to the
seller's account.
